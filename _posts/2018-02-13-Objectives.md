The goal of this blog is to journal my learning experiences as I try to expand my technical knowledge of automation.
I have had a solid background in industrial engineering, math and OR but I want to get more experienced in coding and designing.

Either way, it should an interesting view into the trials and errors of trying to learn new topics!
